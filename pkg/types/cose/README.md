**COSE Type Data Documentation**

This document provides a definition for each field that is not otherwise described in the [cose schema](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/pkg/types/cose/v0.0.1/cose_v0_0_1_schema.json). This document also notes any additional information about the values associated with each field such as the format in which the data is stored and any necessary transformations.

**How do you identify an object as an cose object?**

The "Body" field will include an "coseObj" field.
